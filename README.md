# Canopy

Shared context store. One Cloudflare Worker on one origin serves the HTTP API,
a stateless MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, and a full single-page app (TypeScript + Vite,
served via the ASSETS binding). Live at `canopy.saplinglearn.com`.

- `shared/` — Zod contract, vocabulary, D1 row types (imported by `src/` and `web/`)
- `src/` — Worker: `index.ts` (router), `routes.ts` (Hono HTTP), `mcp.ts` (MCP tools),
  `consumer.ts` (the gate — replay-safe, hash-deduped, change-typed), `db.ts`, `tools/`
- `web/` — Full SPA with screens: My Work (default dashboard), Feed, Docs, Roadmap,
  Triage, Search, Settings, and a Get Started guide. Built to `web/dist`.
- `migrations/` — D1 SQL (`0001_init` … `0010_triage_resolve`)
- `plugins/canopy/` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — the Canopy **plugin** and the marketplace
  that distributes it (see **Install the Canopy plugin**). Bundles the three skills — `canopy`
  (umbrella + `query` reference), `load-context` (read/orient), `record-session` (session-end batch
  writer) — under `plugins/canopy/skills/`, plus the auto-wired MCP server.
- `.claude/skills/` — symlinks into `plugins/canopy/skills/` so this repo's own sessions load the
  bundled skills directly (single source of truth; nothing to keep in sync)

## Read side

FTS5 full-text search: `query()` ranks by bm25 + authority flag, assembles full bodies for
top hits, and returns ranked pointers for the rest. Backs `GET /search` and MCP `query`.
`get_doc` fetches a single doc with all its versions; `get_feed` streams the activity feed;
`get_roadmap` merges live GitHub progress at read time (degrades gracefully if token absent).

## Write side (agents stage, humans confirm)

Every agent write flows through the gate in `src/consumer.ts` — replay ledger
(`processed_items`), content-hash dedupe, change-typing (new/edit/rewrite), and
out-of-vocab or low-confidence entries route to `needs_triage`. HTTP confirm routes
(promote, ratify, reject, assign, discard) are session-cookie-only — never MCP tools.

MCP write tools: `append_feed`, `propose_doc_update`, `propose_milestone`, `set_focus`, and
`record_session` (the session-end batch writer — a whole `IngestPayload` through the same gate).

## The living loop (the skills)

Canopy stays current because agents continuously feed it and humans curate it. Three skills under
`.claude/skills/` drive that loop — **this is the root of how the context system stays alive**, not a
side feature:

1. **Orient — `load-context`** (auto-fires, read-only). Before an agent works an existing area it pulls
   the relevant context via `query` (assembled bodies + ranked pointers, each authority-flagged), so it
   builds on what's already there instead of guessing.
2. **Work** — the agent does the task.
3. **Record — `record-session`** (explicit: "record this session"). At the end it observes what actually
   shipped (`git`/`gh`), reads the affected docs back from Canopy for a true base, and stages **one**
   reconciled batch through the `record_session` MCP tool (same gate as `POST /ingest`, reachable over
   the agent's bearer).

The gate reconciles every write — drops no-ops (content-hash), tags each doc change `new`/`edit`/`rewrite`,
and routes out-of-vocab or low-confidence entries to Triage. A human then promotes / ratifies / rejects /
assigns / discards. **Staging + confirmation is what keeps the store trustworthy as it grows**: nothing
goes live unreviewed, and nothing rots, because every session writes back what it learned.

`canopy` is the umbrella skill (the map, plus the full `query` reference in `references/querying.md`);
`load-context` and `record-session` are the two halves it composes — kept separate because one must
auto-fire and the other must never. They live in this repo so they version with the tools they wrap.
To use them from another machine or repo, install the **Canopy plugin** (below) — it bundles all three
skills and auto-wires the MCP server in one step, so there's nothing to copy by hand.

## Develop

- `npm test` — Vitest against a real Miniflare D1
- `npm run typecheck` — type-check worker + web
- `npm run dev` — build web, then `wrangler dev`
- `npm run deploy` — build web, then `wrangler deploy`
- `npm run db:create` / `db:migrate:local` / `db:migrate:remote` — D1 provisioning + migrations
- `npm run build:node` / `npm start` — build and run the Node server (Railway target, below)

## Deploy on Railway (Node)

Canopy is written for Cloudflare Workers and still deploys there unchanged. It also runs on
Railway as a plain Node service. The port swaps the driver, not the SQL: `src/` is untouched,
all 20 migrations and the three FTS5 tables apply as written, and the Workers test suite still
covers the same code.

How the seam works:

- **`server/d1.ts`** implements the D1 surface `src/db.ts` uses (`prepare().bind().first()/.all()/.run()`)
  on top of Node's built-in `node:sqlite`. Node ships SQLite 3.53 with FTS5, so search needs no rewrite.
- **`server/index.ts`** imports the Workers handler from `src/index.ts` and calls it, so routing, auth
  and MCP stay defined once. It serves `web/dist` first, mirroring the `[assets]` binding's precedence,
  and runs the `[triggers]` cron on a timer.
- **`server/stubs/`** stands in for the `cloudflare:*` modules the `agents` package imports for its
  Durable Object features. Canopy never executes those paths; the build fails on any unstubbed one.

The database is a SQLite file on a Railway **volume mounted at `/data`**. Without that volume the
container's disk is replaced on every deploy and the data goes with it. Migrations apply at boot.

Set these service variables (same meanings as the Wrangler secrets above):
`GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`, `COOKIE_SECRET`, and optionally `GITHUB_REPO`,
`ADMIN_LOGINS`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_SERVICE_TOKEN`.
Point the GitHub OAuth App's callback at `https://<railway-host>/auth/callback`.

`/healthz` reports liveness, the database path and the migration count.

## Auth & secrets

Auth gates all data routes (session cookie) and `/mcp` (per-person bearer token), allowing
only active members of the `SaplingLearn` GitHub org. Set these Wrangler secrets:

- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` — a GitHub OAuth App whose callback is
  `https://<host>/auth/callback`.
- `COOKIE_SECRET` — a long random string used to sign the session cookie.

Production: `wrangler secret put GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` (and the others).
Local dev: copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` (git-ignored) and fill it in.

Mint an MCP token from a logged-in session: `POST /auth/mcp-token` → `{ "token": "canopy_mcp_..." }`
(shown once; or use the web app → Settings → MCP access tokens).

## Install the Canopy plugin (skills + MCP in one step)

The three skills and the MCP wiring ship as a Claude Code **plugin**, distributed from this repo as a
marketplace. Anyone on the team gets both in two commands inside Claude Code:

```text
/plugin marketplace add SaplingLearn/canopy
/plugin install canopy@canopy
```

The plugin's MCP config reads your **personal** bearer from `$CANOPY_MCP_TOKEN`, so export it in the
shell that launches Claude Code (e.g. add it to your shell profile), then restart:

```bash
export CANOPY_MCP_TOKEN=canopy_mcp_...   # your token, minted above — per person, never stored in the plugin
```

That auto-wires the `canopy` MCP server (`query` / `get_doc` / `record_session` …) and loads the
`canopy`, `load-context`, and `record-session` skills — no manual `claude mcp add`, no copying skill
folders. (The single-server manual path still works:
`claude mcp add --transport http canopy https://canopy.saplinglearn.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer canopy_mcp_..."`.)

> **Maintainers:** the plugin is at `plugins/canopy/`; the marketplace manifest at
> `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Validate either with `claude plugin validate <path>`. The real
> skill files live under `plugins/canopy/skills/`; the in-repo `.claude/skills/*` entries are symlinks
> into that bundle, so there is a single source of truth and the two can never drift — edit the files
> under `plugins/canopy/skills/`.
