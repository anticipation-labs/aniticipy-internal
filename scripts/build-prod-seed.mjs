`The MCP server is the only write path into Canopy. Coding agents connect over the Model Context Protocol and post the output of a work session through a typed contract; nothing else can mutate the store.

On a missing or invalid credential the server returns a bare 401 with no WWW-Authenticate header and no OAuth discovery — clients must use the configured token.

A fresh MCP server instance is constructed per request (the SDK guards against reuse), and the handler is stateless — there is no Durable Object or long-lived agent.

    body:
`Canopy exposes its context store to coding agents over the Model Context Protocol. Once connected, your agent can read the docs library, feed, and roadmap, and stage new context for human review — all through the same gate that guards every write. Here is how to connect from nothing.

## 1. Sign in

Open Canopy in your browser and sign in with GitHub. Access is gated to active members of the anticipation-labs organization: after the OAuth exchange Canopy checks your membership, and non-members are turned away before any session is created. Members land in the app signed in.

## 2. Mint a personal token

Go to Settings, find MCP access tokens, and click Mint new token. Canopy shows the raw token — it begins with canopy_mcp_ — exactly once. Copy it immediately: only its SHA-256 hash is stored, so it can never be displayed again. This token is your personal credential, and any write made with it is attributed to you.

## 3. Point your agent at /mcp

Add Canopy to your MCP client with the token as a bearer header, using the /mcp path on the same origin where you use Canopy. In Claude Code, drop a \`.mcp.json\` into your project (or run \`claude mcp add\`):

\`\`\`json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "canopy": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://your-canopy-host/mcp",
      "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer canopy_mcp_…" }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

The endpoint is bearer-only. A missing or invalid token gets a bare 401 with no OAuth discovery, so the token must be present and exact.

## 4. Use the tools

Restart your client and the Canopy tools appear in the session. Reads return live data right away: list_docs, get_doc, get_feed, search_context, and get_roadmap. The write tools — append_feed, propose_doc_update, and propose_milestone — never publish directly; they stage a proposal that a human confirms later, and the author is always you, never a value the client supplies.

## Rotating and revoking

Tokens never expire on their own. If one leaks, or you just want a fresh credential, revoke it from Settings and mint a new one — the old value stops working immediately. Keep a separate token per agent or machine so you can revoke them independently.`},

  { slug: "the-gate", section: "reference", title: "The Gate — the single write surface", updated_at: "2026-06-23T09:00:00Z",
    body:
`Every write — from MCP and from the HTTP /ingest path alike — funnels through one set of per-entry gate functions. There is exactly one place that decides write-vs-stage-vs-triage, and adding a new write means adding it here rather than introducing a second surface.

The gate makes three guarantees. First, nothing is guessed: an out-of-vocabulary tag or section, a low-confidence flag, or a milestone marked done is routed to the needs-triage queue instead of being written blindly. Second, the author is always the authenticated principal passed in by the caller; the client-supplied author field is advisory and ignored. Third, agent writes are non-destructive — they land as staged proposals, never as live content.

This is the load-bearing invariant of the whole system: because there is a single gated path, the human review guarantee holds no matter which client is talking to Canopy.`},

  { slug: "auth", section: "reference", title: "Auth", updated_at: "2026-06-25T18:00:00Z",
    body:
`Sign-in is delegated to GitHub via OAuth with PKCE, and access is gated to active members of the anticipation-labs organization. After the OAuth exchange Canopy checks org membership; non-members are redirected to a locked dead-end (/?denied=1) and no session is created.

Humans authenticate with a signed session cookie. Agents authenticate to /mcp with a personal bearer token (canopy_mcp_… prefix), stored only as a SHA-256 hash. The principal — just a GitHub login — is resolved from the session for HTTP and from the bearer for /mcp, and is threaded into the gate as the authoritative author.

The org's OAuth token is retained at the callback, AES-GCM-sealed under the cookie secret (no separate secret), so the roadmap can read GitHub at view time. One subtlety worth knowing: GitHub only accepts https callback URLs for public hosts, so Canopy forces the redirect_uri scheme to https except on localhost — a request that reaches the Worker over http still produces an https callback that GitHub accepts.`},

`Canopy is a single Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) database. The first-class objects are docs, feed entries, decisions (ADRs), and milestones; everything else supports them.

A doc has exactly one promoted version live at a time (docs.current_version), with its full history in doc_versions — each version carries a status of staged or promoted, a change summary, a confidence flag, and an author. Promotion copies a staged version's body into the live doc and bumps current_version; prior versions are never destroyed. The feed table is an append-only log; tags live in entry_tags keyed by entry type and id. ADRs live in their own table with a draft/ratified status. needs_triage holds unplaceable items awaiting a human.

Identity tables (users, sessions, mcp_tokens) and the roadmap tables (milestones, milestone_proposals) round out the schema. The controlled vocabulary — the sections and tags the gate accepts — lives in its own tables and is the gate's source of truth.`},

Entries are immutable: they are never edited or deleted, and a correction is a new entry that references the original. This makes the log auditable and matches how agents actually produce output — one entry per session, never revised after the fact.

Each entry has an author (a GitHub login), a one-line summary, an optional body, and artifacts — pull requests, commits, and issue numbers — stored as JSON and rendered as links. The feed can be filtered by author and by tag at read time. Tags are drawn from the controlled vocabulary, so the filter set is always meaningful.`},

Versioning is non-destructive. An agent's propose_doc_update stages a new version; the live doc is untouched until a human runs promote, which copies the staged body into the doc and advances current_version. Every prior version remains readable through the version-history control, and a page that has a newer staged proposal shows a banner linking to Triage. Exactly one version is promoted (live) at any moment.`},

`Triage is where staged agent output becomes accepted truth. It is the human half of "agents stage, humans confirm," and it is deliberately not reachable over MCP — the confirm actions are session-cookie-authenticated HTTP routes, never agent-callable tools.

There are three queues. Proposals are staged doc versions newer than the live page; promoting one makes it the live version. Decisions are drafted ADRs; ratifying one flips it from draft to ratified. Triage proper holds needs-triage items — agent output the gate could not place — for a human to assign or discard. A staged proposal shows a real line-diff against the promoted version, so the reviewer can see exactly what changes before clicking Promote.`},

`The Roadmap is a timeline of coarse milestones — the altitude above individual GitHub issues. Each milestone has a title, a target date, and a status of upcoming, in progress, or done.

Progress is computed live from GitHub at view time and stored nowhere. A milestone's github_ref is a bare reference — a GitHub milestone number, or a JSON array of issue numbers — resolved against the configured repository using the viewer's stored OAuth token. If the token is absent, expired, or lacks access (for example a private repo read with only read:org scope), the milestone is returned without progress rather than as an error, and the bar renders as unavailable. Completion is never inferred from 100% issue closure: marking a milestone done is always a deliberate human confirm.`},

State is one D1 database, also named canopy, bound as DB; its schema and controlled vocabulary come from the migrations in migrations/, applied to the remote database once. Three secrets configure the runtime: GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET from the GitHub OAuth app, and COOKIE_SECRET (which also seals the stored org token). The public origin is canopy.saplinglearn.com; the GitHub OAuth app's callback is that origin's /auth/callback over https.`},

Decision: every write — MCP tools and the HTTP ingest path alike — funnels through one set of per-entry gate functions. Adding a new write means extending the gate, never introducing a second write surface.

Decision: agents only ever stage. Live changes happen exclusively through authenticated HTTP routes that are never exposed as MCP tools — promote a doc version, ratify an ADR, promote a milestone proposal, complete a milestone. Promotion is non-destructive; prior versions remain.

Decision: delegate sign-in to GitHub via OAuth with PKCE, and gate access to active members of the anticipation-labs organization. Humans get a signed session cookie; agents get hashed per-person bearer tokens for /mcp. Non-members hit a locked dead-end.

Rationale: the team already lives in GitHub, so org membership is the natural access boundary and requires no new credential store. The org's OAuth token is sealed at rest and reused for live roadmap reads.`},
